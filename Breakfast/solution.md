Cryptography - 50 Points

## Question

### Hint

## Solution
Classic Baconian cipher, in which each letter is replaced by a sequence of 5 As
or Bs (or, in this case, binary 1s and 0s). Replacing the 1s and 0s in enc.txt 
will yield the encrypted message, whose letters can be looked up in the 
definition of the Baconian cipher.
