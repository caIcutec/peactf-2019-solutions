Cryptography - 100 Points

## Question
>My regular teacher was out sick so we had a *substitute* today. [Ciphertext](enc.txt)

### Hint
>None.

## Solution
The question suggests this is a substitution cipher. Looking at the Ciphertext file
we see that we are given both the alphabet and the encrypted message, which means
we can decode the message without any fancy stuff. Compare the encoded alphabet with
a regular one and you should be able to find the flag by substituting the original
letters back.
